Hi, I'm Shane

I am a senior at Cornell University majoring in Operations Research Engineering with a minor in business. 
I hope to build a career in the field of data science and machine learning. 
I will be pursuing a Master's in Data Science at the University of Kentucky next year to deepen my understanding of AI.
